# Learning Rust
I'm using this repo to keep track of the examples and other exercises in **The Rust Programming Language** by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.

In particular I'm using the [experimental version of the book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html) that includes interactive quizzes.
